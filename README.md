# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales in an e-commerce environment using machine learning and data analysis techniques. It involves exploring customer segments, identifying trends, and building predictive models based on historical sales data.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Ecommerce_Sales_Prediction_Dataset.csv`, which contains features related to customer behavior, product categories, sales performance, and marketing data.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for **missing values** using `isnull().sum()`
- Analyzed **customer segments** using `value_counts()`
- Viewed dataset structure using `shape`, `tail()`, and `describe()`
- Prepared the dataset for modeling by understanding its distribution and patterns

---

## 📊 Libraries Used

- `pandas` – for data handling
- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` – for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` – for machine learning models and preprocessing

---

## 🔧 Machine Learning (Assuming future steps)

Planned/Implemented models:
- 🔄 Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, null handling)
- 📈 Regression Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- 🧠 Model evaluation with metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Understand customer behavior based on segment and purchase history
- Identify key features influencing sales
- Predict future sales using machine learning models
